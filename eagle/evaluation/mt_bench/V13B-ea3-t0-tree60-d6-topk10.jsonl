The `imap_unordered()` method is used to apply the `os.walk()` function to each directory in the `directory` argument in an unordered manner, which means that the directories will be processed in a random order. The `Pool` class automatically manages the worker processes and their resources, so you don't have to worry about creating and destroying processes manually.\n\nTo use this program, run it from the command line and pass the directory path as an argument, just like before.

Let B\\_n denote the number of full ternary trees with n vertices.\n\nTo find the number of full ternary trees with n vertices, we can use a similar recursive approach as before. The base case is when n = 0, which has only one full ternary tree: the empty tree.\n\nFor the recursive case, we can create a full ternary tree by selecting a vertex and assigning it a value (either 0, 1, or 3). Then, we can recursively create three full ternary trees, one for each child of the selected vertex.\n\nHere's the Python implementation:\n```python\ndef full_ternary_trees(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return 3 * full_ternary_trees(n - 1)\n```\nThis function first checks if n is equal to 0. If it is, it returns 1 (the only full ternary tree with 0 vertices). Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with n - 1, which creates three full ternary trees with n - 1 vertices. Since each of these trees has three children, we multiply the result by 3."], "idxs": [36, 41], "new_tokens": [228, 315], "wall_time": [1.5269837379455566, 1.799159049987793]}], "tstamp": 1758531809.4259927}

Here's an example implementation in Python:\n```python\ndef find_kth_smallest_element(m, n, k, lists):\n    # Find the indices of the first and last elements in the first list\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    while i < m and j < n:\n        if lists[i] < lists[j]:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    # If the first list is exhausted, we can simply return the kth smallest\n    # element from the second list\n    if i >= m:\n        return find_kth_smallest_element(n, k)\n    # If the second list is exhausted, we can simply return the kth smallest\n    # element from the first list\n    if j >= n:\n        return find_kth_smallest_element(m, i)\n    # If the kth smallest element is in the first list, we can find it using\n    # binary search\n    mid = (i + j) // 2\n    if lists[mid] == k:\n        return mid\n    elif lists[i] <= k < lists[mid]:\n        return find_kth_smallest_element(i + 1, mid - i, k, lists)\n    else:\n        return find_kth_smallest_element(mid + 1, j, k, lists)\n```\nThe function takes four arguments: `m` and `n`, the sizes of the two sorted lists, and `k`, the index of the kth smallest element we want to find. It also takes `lists`, a list of lists representing the two sorted lists.\n\nThe function first finds the indices of the first and last elements in the first list, and then checks which list contains the kth smallest element. If the kth smallest element is in the first list, we can use binary search to find its index. If the kth smallest element is in the second list, we recursively call the function with the appropriate arguments to find its index.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(log k), which is linear in the size of the input. The space complexity is also O(", "Yes, there is an algorithm with better time complexity that can find the kth smallest element in the union of two sorted lists in O(1) time complexity. This algorithm is based on the fact that the kth smallest element in the union of two sorted lists is the minimum of the kth smallest elements in each of the two lists.\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python:\n```python\ndef find_kth_smallest_element(m, n, k, lists):\n    # Find the indices of the first and last elements in the first list\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    while i < m and j < n:\n        if lists[i] < lists[j]:\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            j += 1\n    # If the first list is exhausted, we can simply return the kth smallest\n    # element from the second list\n    if i >= m:\n        return find_kth_smallest_element(n, k)\n    # If the second list is exhausted, we can simply return the kth smallest\n    # element from the first list\n    if j >= n:\n        return find_kth_smallest_element(m, i)\n    # If the kth smallest element is in the first list, we can find it using\n    # binary search\n    mid = (i + j) // 2\n    if lists[mid] == k:\n        return mid\n    # If the kth smallest element is in the second list, we can find it using\n    # binary search\n    else:\n        return find_kth_smallest_element(j + 1, k, k, lists[i:])\n```\nThe function works in the same way as the previous implementation, but instead of recursively calling itself with the appropriate arguments, it uses the fact that the kth smallest element in the union of two sorted lists is the minimum of the kth smallest elements in each of the two lists. If the kth smallest element is in the first list, we can use binary search to find its index. If the kth smallest element is in the second list, we can call the function recursively with the appropriate arguments to find its index.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is O(1), which is linear in the size of the input.
